# Super AI Assistant

This project is a localized version of ChatGPT, which utilizes chatgpt to assist us in various interesting tasks such as dialog, translation, drawing and more, Currently, it is focused on enhancing dialog capabilities, but I plan to expand its functionality through future updates.

Sadly, due to the unavailability of an account for debugging, it does not support GPT4 API now, but this problem will be solved as soon as I get an avilable account.

Apart from  ChatGPT, this application also leverages the capabilities of various free ChatGPT sites, made accessible through the  [FreeGPT4](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free) project. These free site are not stable to use, just for you to experience the AI dialog.

This application has been developed using Electron, Vue3, Tailwind, Type Script and Python.
